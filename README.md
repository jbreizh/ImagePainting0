## Introduction

This old research i did to make my lightpainting project. My idea at the time was to stream directly the bitmap to the arduino through bluetooth and after UDP. Before realising it was a doom idea (to slow, network latency/lost unpredictable), i went pretty far as i develop :

* A backend for arduino and ESP8266
* A frontend on android with java
* A Simulator on python to test everything

So much time, hope and desillusion.... i can't trash this work away :-(
